--------------
#### <i class="icon-folder"></i> Getting Started with the PanELK Stack
The PanELK stack is an [Elastic Common Schema](https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-the-elastic-common-schema) implementation for gathering all logging information from the Palo Alto Networks Next Generation Firewall and the Traps application.  

This repository includes:
- Logstash configuration file that will ingest, filter/dissect and enrich events from both the NGFW and Traps.
- Elasticsearch mappings for each of the log event types from the NGFW and Traps.
- Kibana example ashboards that display information from the different log types.
- A docker-compose file that can be used to implement a containerized ELK stack if you don't already have one

For more information on each of the above, details of each and installation see the [Wiki](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/PanELK/wiki)




Get set up by following instructions in the **readme** file for pan_demon.
You'll need docker for the containers that make up the ELK stack.

It's also recommended that you have a Palo Alto Networks (PAN) Next-Generation Firewall for sending logs to the ELK stack.  For linux users, you can use the **genlog** script for simulating logs should you be absent a PAN Firewall.

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Getting Started with Demisto Integration
Once you have your ELK stack set up with incoming logs from the PAN NGFW(s), kick it up a notch by integrating Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR) with Palo Alto Network's Demisto Server!
Instructions are included in the **readme** file for demisto_integration.

> **Note:**

> - Ensure all of your data is being type formatted within ELK before integrating with Demisto.
> - Setting up SOAR integration requires initial setup on **both** the ELK side and Demisto server




# The Build:
# The ELK docker "stack" consists of 3 images with the following image tags:
# - Elasticsearch "E"
# - Logstash "L"
# - Kibana "K"

# Create a directory and place the included docker-compose.yml file  and all yml and conf files inside of it.  CD to the directory and issue the following command:
docker-compose up -d

# restart a single container
docker-compose restart <container name>

# use this command to ensure the three containers comprising the "stack" are running:
docker ps

# NOTE: If you notice a single container is exiting or not running, restart the container with docker-compose command but without the -d option so it'll show interactive messages
# Connect to the Kibana portal: (replace localhost with docker server IP if not on host
http://localhost:5601

# Attach to the shell of a container to get to the command line (you can replace bach with your favorite shell)
docker-compose exec -u 0 elasticsearch bash 
docker-compose exec -u 0 logstash bash
docker-compose exec -u 0 kibana bash
** Detach from container using "exit" command

# To stop the cluster (all containers), type
docker-compose down -v

# ** Pro-Tip:  
docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d

#  Data volumes will persist, so itâ€™s possible to start the cluster again
with the same data using docker-compose up`. To destroy the cluster and the data volumes, just type 
docker-compose down -v

# # # TROUBLESHOOTING:
# Send a test message to UDP port 5550 on logstash
echo 'test message' | nc -v -u -w 0 localhost 5550
# You can also 'cat' the sample traffic logs to simulate PANOS syslog to logstash
# Be aware that there is no timestamp in the first field b/c kibana would dedup the same messages coming in, so ensure you use this command to generate a UNIQUE log
echo $(date +"%a %b %d %T  %Y") $(cat traffic_log_hostname)
# If the netcat test is successful youll see a message:
# Connection to localhost 5550 port [udp/*] succeeded!
# If you don't see an output from the nc command it did not connect to the port on logstash - check that your container is up and running
# TCPdump from docker host machine to check for incoming syslog from NGFW
tcpdump -v -i any -n port 5550
tcpdump -v -i any -n port 5551
#  to see payload of packet and save to log
tcpdump -nnvvXSs 1514 -i any -n port 5550 > capture.log

#  Traffic Generator - For linux only
use genlog <traffic|threat|dataf|.....all>
#  Note on genlog.  NetCAT is used in the script and for some reason it sends two blank streams of data to logstash that result in dissect errors when viewing in kibana.  So for everyone legit log that comes in you'll see two failures.  This is only a result of using this script and the dissect failure entries in kibana can be disregarded.
