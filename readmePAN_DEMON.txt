#The Build:
#The ELK docker "stack" consists of 3 images with the following image tags:
#- Elasticsearch "E"
#- Logstash "L"
#- Kibana "K"

#To deploy this stack (tested on Ubuntu 18.04.2 and Windows10 with 2/26 Docker)
#Create a directory and place the included docker-compose.yml file  and all yml and conf files inside of it.  CD to the directory and issue the following command:
docker-compose up -d

#restart a single container
docker-compose restart <container name>

#use this command to ensure the three containers comprising the "stack" are running:
docker ps

#NOTE: If you notice a single container is exiting or not running, restart the container with docker-compose command but without the -d option so it'll show interactive messages
#Connect to the Kibana portal: (replace localhost with docker server IP if not on host
http://localhost:5601

#Attach to the shell of a container to get to the command line (you can replace bach with your favorite shell)
docker-compose exec -u 0 elasticsearch bash 
docker-compose exec -u 0 logstash bash
docker-compose exec -u 0 kibana bash
** Detach from container using "exit" command

#To stop the cluster (all containers), type
docker-compose down -v

#** Pro-Tip:  
docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d

# Data volumes will persist, so itâ€™s possible to start the cluster again
with the same data using docker-compose up`. To destroy the cluster and the data volumes, just type 
docker-compose down -v

###TROUBLESHOOTING:
#Send a test message to UDP port 5550 on logstash
echo 'test message' | nc -v -u -w 0 localhost 5550
#You can also 'cat' the sample traffic logs to simulate PANOS syslog to logstash
#Be aware that there is no timestamp in the first field b/c kibana would dedup the same messages coming in, so ensure you use this command to generate a UNIQUE log
echo $(date +"%a %b %d %T  %Y") $(cat traffic_log_hostname)
#If the netcat test is successful youll see a message:
#Connection to localhost 5550 port [udp/*] succeeded!
#If you don't see an output from the nc command it did not connect to the port on logstash - check that your container is up and running
#TCPdump from docker host machine to check for incoming syslog from NGFW
tcpdump -v -i any -n port 5550
tcpdump -v -i any -n port 5551
# to see payload of packet and save to log
tcpdump -nnvvXSs 1514 -i any -n port 5550 > capture.log

# Traffic Generator - For linux only
use genlog <traffic|threat|dataf|.....all>
# Note on genlog.  NetCAT is used in the script and for some reason it sends two blank streams of data to logstash that result in dissect errors when viewing in kibana.  So for everyone legit log that comes in you'll see two failures.  This is only a result of using this script and the dissect failure entries in kibana can be disregarded.
